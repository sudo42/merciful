## *M*obile *E*ndpoint for *R*eading *C*ontent from *I*nternet *F*orums. *U*sually *L*agging!

This application aims to display the contents of a particular HTML-based forum in a more mobile friendly way (a so called _app_, for example).
It will be a first approach, likely consisting of horrific undocumented code full of ~bugs~ features.
Refactoring and/or reimplementing everythingâ„¢ is planned after "version 0" of this project provided sufficent insight in required functionality, acceptable workarounds, technical limits, etc. and the author is still motivated.

Basicly, HTML sources will be parsed, relevant contents extracted and mapped to native UI elements.
With a bit of luck and even more work, these planned fetures might be usable some day:
 - Multiple optional ways for (semi-)permanent storage of authentication data
 - Endless scrolling with bookmarks
 - URL handling (internally and from other apps)
 - PMs
 - Caching
 - Configurable native notifications
 - (Optional) 3n(ryp7i0n and/or password protection
 - Easter eggs

At the moment, the only targeted platform seems to be Android ... but right now, only (meta) data regarding login/authenticatin, potential views, communication, site structure, selectors, URLs, etc. is collected.
